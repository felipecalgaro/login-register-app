# 🌐 Login and register app

### 📃 Description

This project is an app built entirely by myself for studying purposes. There are three implemented pages: a log in page, where you can put your informations, or if you aren't registered yet, you should go to the register screen to create a new user. The other one is to recover your password by informing your account email (the back-end logic is not implemented yet).
